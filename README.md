# 💻 OOP-s Interview Questions – C++ Practice Repository

Welcome to the **OOP-s Interview Questions** repository!  
This collection includes a variety of C++ programs focused on solving core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) problems — ideal for interview preparation, college assignments, and brushing up your coding logic.

---

## 📚 Repository Highlights

This repository contains several C++ programs that demonstrate:

- ✅ OOP Concepts (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)
- ✅ Basic-to-Advanced class structures
- ✅ Real-world problem modeling using C++
- ✅ Interview-level logical programs and solutions
